## How to contribute files💻
to "upload" your files to this repo, you need to join the discord community and upload the files you want to contribute in a .zip file and send them with a message: "I AGREE FOR ATTACHED TO BE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE" and add a  description (e.g the location of where the tags are from or what brand of thing do they open...)
 (if your contribution passes my review, you will be credited and the files will be uploaded to the repo (possibly renamed)) 
## How to understand filenames ❓
