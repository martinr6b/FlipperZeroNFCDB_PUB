## How to contribute files
to "upload" your own files to this repo you need to Discord DM me (link above) and upload the files you want to contribute in a .zip file and send them with a message: "I WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE NFCRFIDDDB REPO AND AGREE FOR ATTACHED TO BE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE"
 (if your contribution passes my review, you will be credited and the files will be uploaded to the repo (possibly renamed))
